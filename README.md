# playmp3s
playmp3s: This is a rather ugly little script that does a nice job of playing back MP3s, back announcing, reading news, etc.  It even creats a web page with the playlist.  Put in on a UNIX box and have it feed a little Part 15 FM transmitter and you are on the air.  As tested at Burning Man. :-)
